FAQ
===

**Q.** Why?

**Ans.** Because Windows Day One support is sad.

**Q.** Hasn't this been done before on BitBucket

**Ans.** Yes and No. The bitbucket one is in .NET. Very sucky. Python is cross-platform and has everything you need.

**Q.** Bugs exist

**Ans.** Yes they do.


How to Run this?
================

1. You can run it from IDLE
2. You can run it from command prompt/terminal with the command - "python pyDayOne.py"
3. You can compile it into an exe/app and if you do, you can give it to me too, so I can distribute it to people. :)
